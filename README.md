# Pandas-Challenge Analysis
•	Both math and reading scores remain consistent and have developed a trend across the different grade levels. We can see this when we group per unique school.

•	Based on the visual data frames, it seems that the passing scores for Math are consistently low across every metric. The difference between the two subjects (Reading and Math) is that reading passing rates are greater in low performance schools, and schools with a high student spending. 

•	One obvious observation is that the schools that rank in the top 5 are all Charter Schools while, the bottom are District Schools. Per-student spending looks to be higher in the lower 5 schools vs schools that rank higher.

•	Looking at passing rates, those with low student population have a higher passing rate vs to schools that have over 2000 students. Although there could be a logical explanation to this, the lower the number the higher the passing rate due to a lower count vs those of a higher count (i.e. if one student of every 4 pass that’s 25% passing, whereas if there is a passing rate of 1 out of every 8 students.).
